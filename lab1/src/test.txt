With the big bad devil's food cake.
Is it the baker who gave you a cake
We ask them for bread and get ?let them eat cake?

And the maid comes in with coffee and cake

And when you stand before the candles on a cake
There's no bread, let them eat cake
In the wedding cake?
I want to be the girl with the most cake
I light the candles and I cut the cake
I put my face down in the cake
What's up? They all want the cake

After Canada the USA's a piece of cake
makes you humble for the pot, I know he's accustomed to the cake
Want a big piece of the cake
Is sweeter than the cake
Back the cake,

When there was still one piece of cake
when it comes to brains I take the cake
That's nice, but it's just icing on the cake.

And a red-head freckled face blows out the candles on his birthday cake
